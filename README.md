# Introduction

This is the implementation of the 3 assignments requested.
There is a bash file in order to execute the tree assignments, one after another.


The 2 first assignments, will be tested running against a standalone jar file.

The 3th one, can be launched same way (java -jar <file>.jar) and launch curl calls 
 to test the Rest Api.
 
# Binaries creation

It's a Maven based project, so you need a maven installation, along with Jdk 1.8.

 Execute only _mvn clean install_ at base dir, and then you can launch _demo.sh_ or test whatever you want
 
# Documentation

Once you launch the rest api server, you can access its documentation opening
 http://localhost:8181/doc/assignment3.html.
 
 This documentation is autogenerated when compilation finish.
